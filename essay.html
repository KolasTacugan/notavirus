        <p>To my Carl Lorreine,</p>
        <p>When I was just about ready to give up on love, the universe had its own quiet way of proving me wrong.</p>

        <p>I still remember swiping on Bumble without really knowing what I was looking for. I came across your profile and, half-jokingly, thought to myself that I probably couldn’t handle your attitude—purely based on your pictures. I said “oh well” and swiped right anyway. And I’m so glad I did.</p>

        <p>At first, I truly believed I wasn’t capable of getting attached anymore. I told myself I was just talking casually, nothing serious. But somewhere along the way, we fell into a routine, and I started to look for you without even realizing it. I denied it for a while. I had my walls up, convinced this would be another short-lived thing—one of those connections that ends after a couple of weeks when you find a reason to walk away.</p>

        <p>But we didn’t.</p>

        <p>When I got hospitalized, what hurt most wasn’t being admitted. It was knowing I wouldn’t get to have our usual sleep calls or movie nights. That’s when it hit me—how much you had already become part of my life. I was developing real feelings, even if I was still scared to admit it back then.</p>

        <p>You have this way of getting through to me so naturally. With you, I feel safe. Talking to you feels easy—except, of course, when I have to speak in Tagalog. When you first told me you were coming to see me, I panicked. Not because I was hiding anything, but because I was scared that meeting in person might change everything. What if we noticed something we didn’t like?</p>

        <p>But it didn’t change things. It only made me love you more.</p>

        <p>As cheesy as it sounds, this is the first time I’ve felt truly secure in a relationship. I stopped overthinking. During those seven days, I felt at home, and I couldn’t get enough of spending time with you. Our situation isn’t always easy, but I’m grateful to have someone I can miss—someone who makes distance feel meaningful.</p>

        <p>This Valentine’s Day, even if I can’t be there physically, I’d love to go back to how we started. Just us, watching a movie together.</p>

        <p>So let me ask you, sincerely:</p>

        <p class="italic-question">Will you be my Valentine?</p>
