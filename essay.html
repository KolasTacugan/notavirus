        <p>To my Carl Lorreine,</p>
        <p>
          For the first time in my life, I’m actually scared of dying—because it would mean leaving you.
        </p>

        <p>
          You once asked me when, or how, I knew I had feelings for you. This was it. I never really feared death before, not because I was troubled or depressed, but because I never felt like I had anything to hold on to. Until you.
        </p>

          September 18, 2025. I was swiping with no intention of finding love, or even someone to talk to. The app was supposed to be deleted the next day. But like the butterfly theory, small things really do turn into something big. Honestly, I thought this would last two weeks—maybe a month at most. But somehow, you always found your way through me. I tried to sabotage us for weeks, but it was too good to break.
        </p>

        <p>
          And I think that’s what I love most about us—everything just came naturally. The daily chitchat, the movies, the sleep calls. It slowly became routine. And no matter how long I tried to deny it, I couldn’t anymore.
        </p>

        <p>
          November 12, 2025. The day I got admitted. When I was told I had to stay in the hospital, my first thought wasn’t fear—it was losing our routine. I may not have loved you yet, but that was when I realized my feelings had grown more than I ever planned. I was scared, but at the same time, I felt safe.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the days passed and the doctors still couldn’t properly diagnose me, I wasn’t getting any better. And for the first time in my life, I wasn’t ready to give up. The thought of not getting to experience life with you felt unbearable. As cliché as it sounds, you were exactly what I needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Everything with you feels easy—except when I have to speak in Tagalog. During the days we spent together, I never felt more at home. And for someone who was so against long-distance relationships for years, I’m glad I have one with you. That’s how I knew how secure I felt in this relationship.
        </p>

        <p>
          This Valentine’s Day, I may not be there with you physically. But I want to go back to how we started—how we’ve always been. Just us, on Discord, watching a movie.
        </p>

        <p>
          So allow me to ask my girlfriend, the love of my life, my wife:
        </p>

        <p class="italic-question">Will you be my Valentine?</p>
